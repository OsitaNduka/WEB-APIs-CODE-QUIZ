# WEB-APIs-CODE-QUIZ

## Description

This is a Web APIs code quiz. As a front-end web developer bootcamp student, its very possible that I'll encounter an interview process where I will be required to complete an assessement based on  a timed multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

I created this Web APIs code quiz to practice what I have learned from this module. It gave me the opportunity to test my knowledge on HTML, CSS and Javascript. 


## Usage

As you click the start button a timer will start and the first question appears. When correct answer is clicked, next question appears but if the answer is wrong the timer wil deduct ten secounds from the countdown.

When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the quiz will end and it will display their score and give the user an opportunity to save their initials and their score.
